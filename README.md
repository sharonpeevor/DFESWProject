# DFESWProject - Spring Boot Software Development bootcamp final project

### **o	Why are we doing this?**

The overall objective of the project is to create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules we have been taught during the bootcamp. It demonstrates our knowledge and learning from the seven weeks of teaching and it is great to be able to combine the various topics to create an API. For my project, I chose a campsite booking system, as I have a campervan and love going away in it with my dog.

### **o	How I expected the challenge to go**

I was a little apprehensive about the project as I had never done anything like this on my own, and it seemed to be fairly complex with a lot of sections required. However, I was reassured that we had done a similar project last week, so I had the code from that and could look back and ensure mine followed the same format. I spent a long time on Monday setting up my Jira board and am very glad I planned thoroughly, in order to encompass all the requirements on the project spec. This ensured that nothing was missed and I followed the correct sequence of events when building the API.

### **o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**

The project has gone really well, I have closely interacted with my Jira board and have followed the steps as I planned to. I had taken good notes last week which was really helpful in reminding me how to do certain things, therefore I am pleased that I have managed to complete the project largely without assistance. The main issue I had was with the feature branches, as I created them all at the start of the project instead of as I went. This meant that when I had finished the first feature branch and merged with the dev branch, I then moved to the next feature branch and found that my work on the previous feature branch had disappeared. I now understand why this was, but I hadn't fully appreciated the concept before. This was a really useful lesson as I now understand branching much better. All the code ran as expected and I had no issues connecting to MySQL and the H2 console. I was able to test Postman and take screenshots from there and from MySQL. All the tests passed except for the custom query I had added in, which is now resolved.
